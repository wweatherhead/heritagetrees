1,Entrance,43.06706728,-89.43001435,"Welcome to the entrance to Forest Hill Cemetery! Inside this cemetery are some of the luminaries of Wisconsin, including many names that you might be familiar with: Birge, Van Hise, Smith, and more. As a matter of fact, Birge, and Van Hise are right behind you (if you’re facing Tree 1). Some interesting information about Van Hise: he was a eugenicist. However, his contributions to Wisconsin and geology are significant. Are his views on eugenics and racism enough to outweigh the good his contributions have done? Should we judge figures of the past based on modern standards? Ponder these questions as you move to the next stop, as they will definitely be important there.",Begin your tour in front of the main gate.,Tree1.jpeg
2,Mausoleum and Confederate Plot,43.06454001,-89.42956996,"Welcome to the second stop! Slightly behind you is a confederate plot from the civil war, where 140 POWs are buried after time spent in Camp Randall, the former Union military encampment. This is also the northernmost confederate burial plot in the US. In 2018, the Madison city council voted to remove the plaque detailing all of the names of the soldiers. Was this the right thing to do? Does this grave deserve to be here? Do these traitors to the nation deserve to have their names memorialized? Who gets to decide that?",Travel down the main path until you reach the second stop.,tree2.jpeg
3,Tree 3,43.06404199,-89.43011304,"Welcome to the third stop! Let’s take a step back and talk about the heritage trees. What is the root cause of celebration? The fact that they survived human advancement? Is the fact that they simply weren’t torn down really a cause to celebrate? Why has that become the norm rather than the exception? And we must also consider “heritage”. Who’s heritage? The United States, the county that seems too eager to terraform every aspect of the land in which it inhabits, land that did not originally belong to them? All of this considered, what is the name “heritage tree” other than a propaganda tool to give legitimacy to the United States and its 248 years of existence? However, the trees themselves are not at fault, and as you continue your stroll, reflect on what they mean to you and to your surroundings. ",Keep going down the path and take the first right.,tree3.jpeg
4,Tree 4,43.06359,-89.43028,"Fourth spot down, 3 more to go. As you’ve been walking on this path, you might have taken a look at a few of the graves around you. On some of them, there are couples plots where a husband and wife are buried together where the woman is referred to as “Wife of ___”. By including that tagline, the only thing you know about the person buried there is that they were somebody’s wife, but is that really all that should be remembered? Take for example the grave of Charles Adams. The epitaph lists his accomplishments, all of his presidencies. Underneath his epitaph is Mary Adams’s, whose sole listing is “His devoted wife and faithful coadjutor”. A summation of a person’s entire life entirely focused on their relationship with somebody else. Is that right? Can we do better? I’ll start: Mary Jane Mathews was an accomplished poet and author, best known for her study of Shakespeare and her hymns which she authored. On your way to the next stop, pick a grave around you and see if you can find any information about them.","Double back to the main path, then take the next available right.",tree4.jpeg
5,Tree 5,43.06354001,-89.43130003,"When speaking of heritage and memory, it might be important to learn the history of the land you now stand on. This plot of land was purchased as the official city of Madison cemetery in the 1850’s, bought from the Wright family. Sections of it were sold off later in its history to build the golf course to the south and Resurrection Cemetery to the west. Before all that, however, this was native american land. Forest Hill Cemetery holds four effigy mounds within its borders: A goose, two panthers, and a line. There were once 7, and three were destroyed by cemetery and railroad development. How ironic, then, that one culture’s religious practices were destroyed to make room for another’s. Although the effigy mounds are not included in this tour, they are not far from the final stop. Consult the cemetery’s official website for more details.",,tree5.jpeg
6,Tree 6,43.06308997,-89.43181,"Congratulations on making it to the second to last stop. This will be a point of self reflection. Thus far, we have discussed how others will be remembered, and now it's your turn. What will your legacy be? Who would you like to be remembered by? What will your impact on the world be? What will you be remembered for? Your work? Your personality? The things you do for others? As you continue to the final stop, think about how amazing you are and the people that appreciate you",Follow the left side of the path until you reach the 6th tree.,tree6.jpeg
7,Tree 7,43.06237,-89.43271002,"You currently stand in front of the final heritage tree in Forest Hill Cemetery. At this stop, I would like to talk about my grandfather, Richard Root. He was an asphalt engineer that revolutionized many aspects of road asphalt. He loved to play softball, even well into his senior years. His team was usually one of the best in his league, and I often went to watch his games. He loved rootbeer floats and coke and taking his boat out on the lake with the grandkids. He was the one who first taught me how to drive both boat and car. He was taken from me on March 19th, 2024 by a heart attack while playing softball. I was in the airport in Detroit on the way to see him. I will remember him for his warmth, his snarky attitude, his endearing love for Alabama football. I will remember him for breaking my fishing rod while trying to catch a carp off our dock. I will remember him for our shared love of good steaks and our subsequent trip to Montana Jack’s in Rock Island, Illinois. I will remember. As you make your way back to the entrance, reader, call those you love most and tell them so. How will you remember them?","Continue straight until you reach a crossroads, then turn right.",tree7.jpeg
